This project delves into data related to state and federal minimum wage laws in the United States of America, encompassing states and U.S. territories. The data is presented through interactive line graphs that can be filtered by state and year. These line graphs illustrate the changes in minimum wage laws driven by state legislation, federal law, and the cumulative impact of both state and federal laws. Additionally, a dedicated line graph is available to display the equivalent wage for the year 2020.

For a broader perspective, we have included a heat map that aids in identifying larger trends in minimum wages by utilizing equivalent values for the year 2020.

*Notable Observations:*
- Based on 2020 equivalent values, minimum wage laws have remained relatively stable, with only a modest upward trend starting in the 1990s.
- When considering actual values, state minimum wages, federal minimum wages, and their combined effects have all exhibited consistent upward trends.
- The heatmap analysis reveals that minimum wages, based on their 2020 equivalent values, reached their lowest points in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
- Regionally, non-continental U.S. states and territories had higher average minimum wages until the 1980s. Over the past decade, the northeast region has maintained the highest average minimum wage, with the District of Columbia and Massachusetts being major contributors.
